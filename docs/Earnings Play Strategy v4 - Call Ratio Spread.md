# **Earnings Play Strategy – Optimized Call Ratio Spread**
*(With Dynamic Buffer Adjustments, Risk Hedging, and Execution Enhancements)*

---

## **Objective**
Execute a **Call Ratio Spread** on **fundamentally strong, sector-leading companies** during **earnings season** to capitalize on:

- **Implied Volatility (IV) crush**
- **Theta decay**
- **Asymmetrical bullish exposure**
while maintaining **a defined risk-reward structure** with **enhanced risk mitigation**.

This strategy has been optimized to **maximize profitability** by dynamically adjusting:

- **Buffer size** based on **historical stock movement, IV conditions, and market trends**
- **Call ratio** based on **IV Rank and Expected Move (EM)**
- **Upside protection** via **selective use of deep OTM protective calls**
- **Hedging adjustments based on skew and institutional flow**
- **Automated trade execution using conditional orders**

---

## **Step 1: Stock Selection Criteria**

### ✅ **Sector-Leading Companies**
- Must be among the **top players in their industry** with a **strong earnings track record**.

### ✅ **Strong Fundamentals**
- Look for **consistent EPS growth** and **positive earnings surprises**.
- **Monitor guidance trends** (bullish or bearish commentary).

### ✅ **Liquidity & Option Market Suitability**
- **Ensure high option liquidity** (tight bid-ask spreads, high open interest).
- **Avoid low-liquidity stocks**, which can lead to **high slippage and poor fills**.

### ✅ **Earnings Move Consideration**
- **Focus on stocks with strong bullish post-earnings reactions** (historical beats & uptrends).
- **Avoid stocks with extreme post-earnings whipsaws** (>10% downside move).
- **Check call skew** to assess upside expectations.
- **Monitor institutional order flow** to gauge large trader sentiment.

---

## **Step 2: Trade Setup – Call Ratio Spread**

📌 **Goal:** Profit from **post-earnings IV crush** and **theta decay**, while allowing for controlled bullish exposure.

### **Trade Components**
- **Buy 1 Call** at a strike price based on the **Expected Move (EM) + dynamic buffer**.
- **Sell 2-3 Calls** at a **higher strike price (2-5% above the long call)**, depending on **IV Rank and risk appetite**.
- Ensure a **net credit or minimal entry cost** to **reduce margin requirements**.

### **Strike Price Selection – Dynamic Calculation**

1. **Calculate Expected Move (EM)**

```
EM = (At-the-Money Call Premium + At-the-Money Put Premium) / Stock Price
```

2. **Long Call Strike Calculation (With Dynamic Buffer)**

```
Long Call Strike = Current Stock Price + (EM + Dynamic Buffer)
```


3. **Short Call Strike Calculation**

```
Short Call Strike = Long Call Strike + (2% to 5%)
```


- **If IV Rank > 85, consider selling 3 calls instead of 2.**
- **If IV is extremely high, widen the spread to reduce early assignment risk.**

4. **Protective Call (Optional for High-Risk Scenarios)**
- If **IV Rank > 85** or **historical earnings moves exceed 7%**, buy an **extra OTM call** (10-15% above the short call) for risk hedging.

## **Step 3: Historical Price Movement & Dynamic Buffer Adjustments**

📊 **Decision Matrix for Buffer & Ratio Adjustments**

🔍 **Review the past 2 years of post-earnings price action**:
- **Calculate the minimum, maximum, and average post-earnings moves** across the last 8 earnings releases.
- If **Max Move > EM + 5%**, widen the strike difference.

| **Condition**                      | **Buffer Recommendation**                   | **Ratio Adjustment**                  | **Protective Call?**  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **IV Rank < 50**                   | **3-5% (Small buffer)**                     | **1:1 (Call Debit Spread)**            | No                   |
| **IV Rank 50-70**                  | **5% (Balanced risk-reward)**               | **1:2 (Standard Ratio Spread)**       | No                   |
| **IV Rank 70-85**                  | **5-7% (More conservative)**                | **1:2 or 1:3**                        | Yes, if EM > 7%      |
| **IV Rank > 85**                   | **3-5% (Avoid overpricing risk)**           | **1:3 (Higher premium capture)**      | Yes, always          |
| **Historical Earnings Move < 5%**  | **3-5% (Tighter risk control)**             | **1:2**                               | No                   |
| **Historical Earnings Move 5-7%**  | **5% (Optimal balance)**                    | **1:2**                               | Yes, if IV Rank > 80 |
| **Historical Earnings Move 7-10%** | **7-8% (Increased safety)**                 | **1:3**                               | Yes, mandatory       |
| **Historical Earnings Move > 10%** | **8-10% (Higher upside risk protection)** | **Avoid trade OR hedge aggressively** | Always               |

## **Step 4: Expiration Date Selection**
📅 **Choose 9-15 Days to Expiration (DTE) for optimal theta decay**.

🚫 **Avoid weekly expirations before earnings** to **minimize excess IV exposure**.

---

## **Step 5: When to Enter the Trade**
✅ **Enter the trade 1-3 days before earnings** to **maximize IV expansion**.

✅ **Best Entry Timing Based on IV Trends**
- **IV Rank > 70** → **Enter 2-3 days before earnings.**
- **IV Rank 50-70** → **Enter 1-2 days before earnings.**
- **IV Rank < 50** → **Avoid trade** (IV crush will be insignificant).

---

## **Step 6: Post-Earnings Trade Management**
🔍 **Monitor price movement for 1-3 days after earnings** and exit accordingly.

✅ **If Stock Rises Above Long Call Strike** → Let the long call run; manage short calls.  
✅ **If Stock Nears Short Call Strike** → Monitor closely; roll if necessary.  
✅ **If Stock Exceeds Short Call Strike** → Exit immediately to avoid assignment risk.  
✅ **Use trailing stops on long calls to lock in profits.**  
✅ **Consider rolling short calls if IV remains elevated.**
